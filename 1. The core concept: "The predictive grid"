In a traditional grid a nuclear or a coal plant can be turned up when poeple wake up. In a renewable grid, one can't turn the sun or the wind on. Therefore, our AI plattform has three specific jobs:
1. Forecast: How much energy will the sun/wind generate in 15 minutes?
2. Flexibility: Which batteries or EVs can I charge now while the sun is shining?
3. Trading: Sells the excess energy to the market automatically.
